TW are more likely to be attacked in the women's room than in the men's room. This isn't about safety - it's about embarrassment. But when men who aren't trans abuse these policies, it IS about safety & becomes very dangerous for women & girls. But no one cares.
Mr McConnell, u are a hypocrite and sadist, getting off on your power trip to screw the middle & lower classes. Your sickening trumpfest today shows cowardice, as u let him dismantle our democracy, get away w/ salacious abuse of women, and make the masses grovel for health care.
i haven't said anything. i've RT'd sometimes, talked about it (hella) off the timeline, written a lil bit, and reflected on where i fit in this picture as a man.

and that's the whole thing: i do. even if i don't abuse or assault women, i do.

and to the men reading: you do, too.
Women victims of sexual abuse:  keep your stories coming.  Slime ball, predator men must be exposed and punished!
By your logic no unplanned or unwanted pregnancies would happen ever and yet they do... All the time.. Women get pregnant as a result of abuse and rape.
#alcoholawareness Yes and all men and women too must do their part with their drinking-Alcohol major risk factor for violence and abuse,sexual harrassment and assaults,Cancers and so much more harm
Glenn Thrush and the tRump will ALWAYS be known as men who have no respect for women. They used their power and position to abuse and demean them. In tRump's case it went as far as rape. Enjoy the company you abusive creeps.
Your daughter is as ignorant as you are.  If she wants to empower women, how about starting with getting you into prison for all the sexual abuse you brag about.  Now that would be power!!  Both of you are disgusting!1
I did read the story. Like I have read countless others. The point I am making is about the wider issue of these kind of extremely rare stories being over emphasised particularly by men in the media who abuse their platform and positions of power to spread hate against women.

Read: Abused Men, the Hidden Side of Domestic Violence. And: When Women Sexually Abuse Men,  the Hidden Side of Rape,  Stalking,  Harassment and Sexual Assault. Both by Philip W Cook. Learn something!
I liked Minnie Driver's statement that men have to stop 'not all men'ing this situation and let women talk about their abuse.
What I learned in 2017:  America has a serious lack of resources for women and children who are victims of domestic abuse, especially victims of narcissists who have turned their families against them through slander! #SpeakUp
Hi there @realDonaldTrump - that sounds like the same damn thing rich, powerful men tell women when they object to abuse. #UnitedNations #TakingNames #Israel
Thank you for caring about people who abuse women, like Al Franken, and showing that no sexual harasser should be rewarded.
Lying. Coverups. Haiti. Libya. Way too many dead associates for any person not serving in the military. The Clinton Foundation. Violation of Federal Law with handling of classified information. History of ignoring husband's abuse of women.

This equality nonsense is doing my box in to be honest. Yes men can be abused. Yes men can be raped. However the majority of abuse and rape and domestic violence is perpetrated against women. I’ve had men tell me they know what it’s like to be abused. Yes as a man they do. But

#MeToo With all the news circulating about celebrity persons experiencing sexual harassment, I feel it is time for the average white collar American woman to voice her sexual harassment/rape in the workplace. The reasons for not reporting are based on many circumstances.

You right wingers often lack reading comprehension. The #metoo hashtag was a double entendre and was entirely appropriate. YOU replied to a tweet about MY PHYSICAL APPEARANCE. To most #antifa, that implies online sexual harassment. Hence the “block #metoo.” Actually kinda clever.

@StormyDaniels Total disgrace to women and a great way to cause people to take the #metoo   movement less seriously. Sure, take the cash. Not like you aren't used to getting paid off for sleeping around. What a disgraceful excuse for a woman.
As someone outside the industry the double-standard applied to Woody Allen and Roman Polanski has made it quite hard to swallow Hollywood's response to the #MeToo movement. The actions the last couple of days that people have taken regarding Woody Allen is much needed.

Leave it to a man who has never been sexually harassed to compare #MeToo to McCarthyism. Perhaps some people get swept up in this that don't deserve to pariahs, but what about the victims of harassment and putting an end to that?
